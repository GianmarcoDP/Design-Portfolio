    <h2>August 13,2020</h2>
    <p>Not much happened today but there are a few things noteworthy. The sites we were introduced to seem interesting but until I actually get to use them I can’t really say much about them. The brainstorming ideas actually shed some more light on what we may be doing in this class, so that was pretty nice.</p>
        <h2>August 14, 2020</h2>
    <p>I feel like not much happened today. It’s been a few months since I used JS, so I basically decided to start from the beginning to refresh myself on it. It’s sort of hard to try and remember it. my memory is sort of blanking so hopefully it’ll get easier from now on but I’m not sure. I am not entirely sure what we were supposed to be doing in the group, was it just sharing assets? What you said at the end made me think we were supposed to work together or something.</p>

    <p>I didn't have a reference photo, so I just tried to create some random guy. Some of the tools were really finicky  so it was hard to get what I wanted</p>
        <h2>August 20,2020</h2>
    <p>It was fairly uneventful today. We decided on which of our ideas we were going to try and make with a vote. While it wasn't mine the idea that we chose was actually pretty similar. We figured out some of the characters we may be working with as well, family, friends, and enemies. We still probably need to figure out more characters, like ones that fill out a more background role. We don't really have all of the story planned out, but we do have a basic beginning and end; and since we know what the story will be about we hopefully will have an easier time in the future.</p>
        <h2>August 24,2020</h2>
    <p>We actually ended up doing most of the outline of the story on a google doc since we didn’t already have that sorted out. We will probably use the whiteboard for when we map out possible routes in the story. We discussed with each other how the main conflict will go. It’ll be more focussed on our character vs society than any single person. We also talked about smaller points of conflict between characters and what is happening in the country in the meantime.
</p>
        <h2>August 25,2020</h2>
    <p>We actually got a lot of sound design done. I was getting Jazz vibes, so I recommended it as background music. After some research rock and roll was becoming a thing during the 50’s so we could include it too . Although I think we could add some that has more to do with the characters but that may be too difficult or needs to be done further into the process. Maile finished the story outline which means we can also get to the branching storyline, which in my opinion is probably going to be extremely hard. I started to put reference images, which prompted more people to get them. That will help for the background art and character designs. I was also thinking about researching how people spoke in the 50’s but that may be too hard, especially since I’m not even sure what state this takes place in.</p>
        <h2>August 27,2020</h2>
    <p>I feel like not much happened today. We did the implicit bias thing but I didn’t get to see my results and it was sort of weird. We finished the first draft of the introduction dialogue. I think it could definitely use some work, but I guess that’s why it’s called a rough draft. I do feel even more inclined to do research on how people in the 50’s speak because what we had felt sort of too modern. We also got to vote on some of the designs Maile made for our main character.
</p>
        <h2>September 1,2020</h2>
    <p>Well, because of the presentation we didn’t actually do anything. I didn’t really even pay much attention to that either because of the combination of being really sleepy, having a headache, and cringing from our own game. Especially from seeing how much other groups got done. Seeing what other groups had did make me feel sort of better but not much. I’m hoping to eventually move on from the google form but I feel like that depends on how much I prepare for it because I feel like I have the most experience coding even though I have zero confidence, especially since it’s been a while since I coded.
</p>
        <h2>September 8,2020</h2>
    <p>I’d say the most accurate way to portray how well our project went is ‘ok’ or ‘good.’ Mostly because while it wasn’t the best, I actually don’t think it was too bad. Granted I do wish it wasn’t on a Google Form, and I think I need to learn JS again. There wasn’t a lot of communication between us but it was enough to get it done to where it is now and I’d say that’s pretty good. I did feel like I could rely on my group to work as well.
      <br></br>
There are definitely places I think could use some improvement besides the format of the game. The most notable being the writing of the plot, which for what we had was mostly me and one other person. This is probably because I read a lot and also being critical of myself but I feel like it was just plainly not well written, maybe it’s because it is just a prologue that I can’t get a sense of where it’s going. There’s also not to mention the dialogue and the way people talk. Since the game is set in the 50’s I know they will have talked differently from how we do now and it actually bothers me that they don’t. 
      <br></br>
As for my own growth during this period, I can’t really say if I have grown. That is sort of a thing that’s happened in most of my dlabs though. The only thing I can think of that could have grown is probably my writing, but I don’t think it’s changed. Honestly it’s probably gotten worse since the last time I wrote something in English class too. Maybe my brainstorming for the game ideas got better but that feels like so long ago I can’t honestly remember. If I actually did improve in something it’s probably something that I’m not paying attention to or don’t think I’ve grown in

        <h2>October 12,2020</h2>
    <p>Not much really happened today. My old group decided against continuing our old project. I didn’t really see how we could even continue it with our new prompt so ‘i didn’t mind. Also the ideas for my pitch I think are pretty bad. Given how vague it is and how many things could apply to it I don’t think I could make a good one. I think my ideas are needlessly, or at least trying to be, profound. Either that or it is entirely too simplistic in my eyes. I am pretty nervous for my pitch tomorrow </p>
        <h2>October 13,2020</h2>
    <p>I decided what I was going to choose for my pitch and practiced a bit but I don’t think I’ll be able to do it smoothly anyway. I thought we were going to do our pitches today but it turned out we weren’t so I have less need to panic. My pitch focuses primarily on world building and a few basic mechanics, and also a basic storyline to follow. I’m not very good at doing things myself so I left out any finer details so people could do their own things. I am still really stuck on basic things and my brain is to jumbled for me to have many coherent ideas right now
</p>
        <h2>October 19,2020</h2>
    <p>I’m not sure that much happened today. Our group sort of already fleshed out the general gist of the story and game mechanics on Friday, so today was mostly just putting them in the trello and GDD. We did confirm the engine we will be working on, so me and Fumiya will work on learning it. Godot has a lot of tutorials we can go through including on how to make 2D things and lighting, which will be really useful. We do have to wait on the final art style but we can just work with place holders for now.
</p>
        <h2>October 23,2020</h2>
    <p>I specifically didn’t get much feedback because of my setbacks. As a group we were asked what specifically our goal was by the end of the cycle, which is just a functioning maze, with maybe some obstacles and an AI. We were also recommended starting a github repo, however I'm not sure how to do that. One of the other groups started completely with concept art and sprites and did not have anything in the shape of programming, which was surprising. Another group had an environment and lighting already set up which was impressive.

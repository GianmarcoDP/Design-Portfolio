    <p class="learn">The coding language used in Godot is something I am not used to, I had to learn it from scratch.</p>
    <p class="learn">Figuring out signals, areas, then connecting them to parent nodes is something that was totally foreign to me </p>
    <p class="learn">After having trouble with errors in my own code I asked for help and was eventually able to figure it out</p>

    <h2>Creative Moments</h2>

    <p id="godot" class="creative">Because we had figured out the story of our game and our fourth memmber was in charge of art we decided to split up the programming/game making so we could get as much done and help each other too.</p>
    <p class="creative">Because none of us really had experience coding in the first cycle we resorted to using Google Forms to make our prototype.</p>
